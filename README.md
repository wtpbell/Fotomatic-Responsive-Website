 Resposive Website Challenge 

This is the first time that I try to make webiste to be responsive. It takes me 2 days to finish it. At the beginning, I was confused that how to start and didn't notice that some of the codes are broken or not completed. Please refer to below.

 1. It only linked to reset.css. 
 2. <meta> tag for viewport was missed. 
 3. Based on the specificaton, there is "Join us" button in tablet format.  Therefore, I added one more class "tablet" that allowed me to add that button only. If you have a better solution, please feel free to share. 
 4. The link of some images were wrong. 
 5. alts were missed. 
 6. In css section, some of the pre-set rules were missed "." 
 7. The specification is different from the solution. I follow the specification. 
 8. Regarding filter section, both specification and solution are showing 3 pictures only, but I keep 4. 

For this README, it may not a full picture of this challenge, but i hope it can help you start.
